# serialization-and-deserialization-with-WPF-and-WCF

At C#, XML file serialized and deserialized using DataContractSerializer at WPF optimization with WCF

This solution has ItemCatalog class for DataContractSerializer.

ItemCatalog class has book's attributes(title,genre,author,publish date, price).

You should add test files into WCF File.

You can't search xml files in system files(bin, App_Data, obj, Properties, scripts).

This project was written with MVC

Model -> ItemCatalog file

View -> WPF file

Controller -> BusinessLayer file
